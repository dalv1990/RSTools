Description: Implements a three-tier client-server architecture to create
    data containers that can be used for dynamic social network modeling
    with RSiena, and other network analysis packages such as sna and
    network. The *data tier* accesses a SQL Server database containing the
    raw study data in three primary tables: an "edge list" representation
    of the networks, a "long form" set of survey records, one per individual
    per wave (assuming longitudinal data), and a table of non-time-varying
    characteristics (e.g. gender, birthdate) with one row per individual. The
    *logic tier* translates database-level data into objects useful for
    network analyses in R. The *presentation tier* will be a script that
    implements these functions to carry out network description and modeling.
